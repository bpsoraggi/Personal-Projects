GET STARTED
To get started take a look to the example rooms.

Go to the creation code of the control_cutscene objects (double-click the object -> creation code).
There you can see examples of how to use it.
You may want to try modifying that code, changing some scripts or arguments and then running the game.

Then you may want to know how to use the scripts. There are more than 30! So how to use them?
In each script there is an explanation about what it does. There you can also see what arguments it needs.
---------------------------------------------------

SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
1. Add a control_cutscene object to the room
2. Make sure there is a layer called "hud" in the room
3. Double-click the control_cutscene object in the room
4. Open the creation code
5. Set these variables:
	- cutscene_id (different for all cutscenes in the same room)
	- cutscene_player (if cutscene_mode is collision, the collision is checked for this object) 
	- cutscene_mode ("collision" or "immediate")
	- persist (true or false)
6. Set the 2d array "scene_info" with all the scripts that constitute the cutscene
7. Here is an example (more are in the example room):
	cutscene_id = 0;
	cutscene_player = example_player;
	cutscene_mode = "collision";
	persist = false;

	scene_info = [
		[cutscene_play_sound,sound_alarm,1],
		[cutscene_wait,1],
		[cutscene_move_object,example_player,170,300,2],
		[cutscene_dialogue_style,noone,c_black,c_white,c_white,1,example_font,noone,true,example_continue1],
		[cutscene_dialogue,"What was that?"]
	];
In this example, the cutscene starts when example_player collides with control_cutscene. The cutscene plays a sound, waits for a second, moves an object and shows dialogue.
---------------------------------------------------

"INTERNAL" SCRIPTS
Ignore them. They take care of themselves.
---------------------------------------------------

DIALOGUE
Cutscene engine has lots of scripts to show text and dialogue. The script names start with "cutscene_dialogue_".

	CHANGING DEFAULT SETTINGS OF DIALOGUE
	If you don't want to call the script cutscene_dialogue_style, cutscene_dialogue_keys, cutscene_dialogue_sprite etc.
	everytime you add dialogue, you can change the default settings in the control_cutscene object.
	If you go to the create event of that object, you will find a "SETTINGS AREA" where you can change variables.

	SMART LINE BREAK CONFIGURATION
	Recently I added a new optional argument to cutscene_dialogue_style: smart line breaks.
	This prevents text from changing line in the middle of a word. However, this is still an experimental
	feature and doesn't work correctly on all projects. If you want to use this feature in your project but
	it doesn't work correctly, you can try this:
	Go to textbox_draw script. Change the variable called linebreak_addition to something else
	(for example: 0, -5 or -10). It's completely possible that this doesn't fix it and you will not be able
	to use this feature. However, I tried to use this feature in 4 different projects and in 3 of them changing
	this variable helped (on 1 project it didn't work at all).
	
	USING DRAW GUI
	Using Draw GUI to draw the dialogue hasn't been tested a lot yet, so I recommend using the normal Draw event.
	But if you want to use it, follow these instructions:
	1. Go to the textbox object.
	2. Change the Draw event to Draw GUI.
	3. Change the draw_gui variable there to true.
	
	Things to note:
	Remember that using cutscene_dialogue_position is of course different when using Draw GUI.
	When using Draw GUI, your camera size and viewport size should be the same, otherwise clicking options with mouse will not work well.

	USING CUTSCENE ENGINE WITH DIALOGUE ENGINE
	I also have a Dialogue engine (https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6657/dialogue-engine-text-boxes).
	If you are using both engines together, you will notice that some objects and scripts have the same name.
	You can delete the duplicates.
---------------------------------------------------

CUSTOM SCRIPTS
You can make your own scripts too. When the thing the script is supposed to do is done, call cutscene_next().
See the other scripts for examples.
---------------------------------------------------

ABOUT UNFINISHED SCRIPTS
Some scripts might not work correctly yet, for example cutscene_skip.
These will be fixed / updated in the future.
---------------------------------------------------

UPDATING THE ASSET
NOTE! If you update the asset from your asset library, if the control_cutscene object gets updated,
Gamemaker will probably remove it from all rooms, and your cutscenes might get removed too.
So if you for some reason want to update it, I recommend doing a backup first.

TUTORIALS
There are some simple tutorials (only one currently...) for this engine on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKIFNtRA1A2r3cJB8alHYw

	SHOWCASING YOUR GAMES
	Have you made a game using this Cutscene engine?
	If so, you can email me a link to the game and I might showcase it on my website or in the marketplace.

	BECOMING A TESTER
	Would you like to try new features earlier? Email me to become a tester for Cutscene engine
	(and Dialogue engine too if you own it). You will also get one of my games for free every time you have
	tested an update, when the update is published.
