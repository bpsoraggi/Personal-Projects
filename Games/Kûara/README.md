<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 📚 About The Project

</div>

Kûara (possible temporary name) will be a crafting top-down game. I plan on having the story element be a very prominent feature, but not the only thing about the game. The player will be able to follow the lore through cutscenes, perhaps a few story choices along the way, and also through visual hints scattered through the map. Once the story is "complete", the game will still be playable and the player will still be able to craft and expand their house/village, etc., similar to how you can still play Minecraft even after defeating the Ender Dragon.

I will keep a few devlogs here to track my progress, but I plan on not exposing too much of the game, especially not story-wise.

<!-- DEVLOG -->
## :heavy_check_mark: DevLog

Here is where I'll be sharing some of the development process. Just a few snippets here and there, nothing too extended.

### June 22nd

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/K%C3%BBara/imgs/inventoryDemo.gif" alt="gif" align="left" width="640" height="360"">
  <div align="left">
    <br><br><br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A lot of the art is done, maybe 20%, depending <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp on how many items there will be in the end. I've <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp done a couple of action animations as well, as <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp can be seen to the left. Right now I'm currently <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp working on the inventory and crafting system, <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp my plan is to have the shell ready first, then go <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp back and polish it later once other features are <br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp complete.
