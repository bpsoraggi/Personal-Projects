## 📚 About the project
This game was created as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. Not all files are included in this directory. This was my first 100% solo project, as well as my very first game.<br>

The game was developed on GameMaker, using the built-in libraries and an asset from the marketplace (cutscene engine).
