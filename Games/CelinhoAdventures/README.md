This game was created as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and was my first 100% solo project, as well as my very first game. The art was very heavily inspired in **Littlewood** by *Sean Young*, I do NOT own any of it. I only used the art as a base because I wanted to focus on the coding aspect of building a game.

## 🔦 Showcase

Here is where I'll be sharing some of the development process. Just a few snippets here and there, nothing too extended.

### Map

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/town.gif" alt="gif" align="left" width="50%" height="50%"">
  <div align="left">
   <br><br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here is a small showcase of the main map. I implemented a simple <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp mechanism to make the buildings transparent whenever the player <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp is behind them to make it easier to see, since the player is relatively <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp small and easy to miss.
   <br><br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my next game, the camera will be a bit more zoomed in.
  </div>
    <br clear="left"/>
</div>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

-------
### Dialogue

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/cutscene.gif" width="45%">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/choice.gif" width="45%">
</p>

I used a dialogue engine to help out, but ended up changing a lot of the code to fit my specific vision for the game. Above, you can see two examples of dialogue:<br>
1) **In a cutscene (right):** Dialogue inside cutscenes were slightly different to normal dialogues because I had to find a way to include them within the cutscene engine that I used for the game.
2) **Normal dialogue (right):** In this specific case, you can also see the implementation of different choices for the player to choose from when interacting with NPCs.
-------
### Cutscenes

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/cutscene2.gif" alt="gif" align="left" width="50%" height="50%"">
  <div align="left">
   <br><br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another example of cutscene. I didn't have much time to work on <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the AI for the cows because they only showed up in this once scene. <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The player cannot move or do anything while this scene plays. It is <br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp one of my plans to implement <b>skipable</b> cutscenes in the next game. <br><br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The speech bubble used in this scene is part of the dialogue engine.
  </div>
    <br clear="left"/>
</div>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

-------
### Room Changes

<div align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/roomChange.gif" alt="gif" align="right" width="50%" height="50%"">
  <div align="left">
   <br><br>
   For room changes, I used a similar logic to dialogue bubbles. When a player comes near an enterable door, it detects the object and draws the bouncing action sprite. Once the player touches the object, it runs the       code for room swapping and checks which room it needs to go to based on the object properties.
 </div>
 <br clear="right"/>
</div>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

-------
### Combat

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/slimes.gif" width="45%">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/bpsoraggi/Personal-Projects/blob/main/Games/CelinhoAdventures/imgs/boss.gif" width="45%">
</p>

For the combat aspect of the game, I kept it simple because it wasn't the focus I wanted. I implemented a dash mechanism where the player's hitbox doesn't exist for a few seconds, allowing them to go through walls and enemies. The dash has a cooldown to prevent exploitation.
<br><br>
The boss was also quite simple, with a pretty basic projectile mechanism that works with the dash mentioned above. For the pruposes of showcasing, I altered the boss's max hp to something lower in order to be able to demonstrate the death animation.
